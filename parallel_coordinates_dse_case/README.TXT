Remember, to open the local files you need to launch an http server.

If you have python in your computer:

python -m http.server


Then launch the browser and go to

http://localhost:8000/

and look for the file.



You can also give the absolute path in your browser

http://localhost:8000/parallel_coordinates_dse_case/index.html
