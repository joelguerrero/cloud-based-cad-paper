Ancillary material for the paper: **Cloud-based CAD parametrization for design space exploration and design optimization in numerical simulations.**


* RGB_market_image => market image and python script to get RGB channels

* SSIM => Sample script and images for image similarity

* parallel_coordinates_dse_case => Interactive parallel coordinates scripts (d3.js)

* soda_can => working worflow of soda can case

* static_mixer => working worflow of static_mixer case (CFD + image similarity)



To use the onshape scripts you will need to create your credentials. You also will need to install the Python API, you can find the installation instructions at this link:

To use the image similarity scripts in the static mixer, you need to install paraview in headless mode (for using pvbatch).
