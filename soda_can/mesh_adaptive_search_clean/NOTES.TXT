If you are using inline braces {} in your template scripts, DAKOTA will try to do inline replacement
replacement in those locations, and sometimes this can give you problems.

For example, line 49 of joe1_evaluate_featurescript.py.template you will find

	"function(context, queries) {return getVariable(context, 'total_surf');}

because of the inline braces, which is the default symbol for inline replacement, DAKOTA will fail 
in doing the substitution.

To avoid this problem you can move the braces to another line (if it is accepted by the script).

Or you can use a different inline replacement delimiter, as follows,

	dprepro --left-delimiter='[[' --right-delimiter=']]'
